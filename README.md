PyH3C
=====

PyH3C is a program for passing h3c authentication in SYSU east campus.


Installation
-------

You need to install dpkt, libdnet and pypcap python library before you run the program.

So for Ubuntu users:

    apt-get install python-pypcap python-dpkt python-dumbnet

For Gentoo users:

    emerge pypcap dpkt libdnet

When you emerge libdnet, remember to have python use flag turn on (It's turned on by default).

Sorry for coming along with lots of dependencies.


Usage
-----

Currently, no command line arguments are supported.
So the only choice you have is using configuration file.

Please checkout pyh3c.conf.example for examples.

You must have root previliege to run the program:

    sudo python pyh3c.py


Contributing
------------

Any contribution is welcome.

It will be great if you can help me make it a better software.
